abstract = {We present evidence for halo assembly bias as a function of geometric environment (GE). By classifying Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy groups as residing in voids, sheets, filaments or knots using a tidal tensor method, we find that low-mass haloes that reside in knots are older than haloes of the same mass that reside in voids. This result provides direct support to theories that link strong halo tidal interactions with halo assembly times. The trend with GE is reversed at large halo mass, with haloes in knots being younger than haloes of the same mass in voids. We find a clear signal of halo downsizing - more massive haloes host galaxies that assembled their stars earlier. This overall trend holds independently of GE. We support our analysis with an in-depth exploration of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model, used here to correlate several galaxy properties with three different definitions of halo formation time. We find a complex relationship between halo formation time and galaxy properties, with significant scatter. We confirm that stellar mass to halo mass ratio, specific star formation rate (SFR) and mass-weighed age are reasonable proxies of halo formation time, especially at low halo masses. Instantaneous SFR is a poor indicator at all halo masses. Using the same semi-analytic model, we create mock spectral observations using complex star formation and chemical enrichment histories, which approximately mimic GAMA's typical signal-to-noise ratio and wavelength range. We use these mocks to assert how well potential proxies of halo formation time may be recovered from GAMA-like spectroscopic data.},

abstract = {Recent Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest tomography measurements of the intergalactic medium (IGM) have revealed a wealth of cosmic structures at high redshift ({\$}z\backslashsim 2.5{\$}). In this work, we present the Tomographic Absorption Reconstruction and Density Inference Scheme (TARDIS), a new chrono-cosmographic analysis tool for understanding the formation and evolution of these observed structures. We use maximum likelihood techniques with a fast non-linear gravitational model to reconstruct the initial density field of the observed regions. We find that TARDIS allows accurate reconstruction of smaller scale structures than standard Wiener filtering techniques. Applying this technique to mock Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} forest data sets that simulate ongoing and future surveys such as CLAMATO, Subaru-PFS or the ELTs, we are able to infer the underlying matter density field at observed redshift and classify the cosmic web structures. We find good agreement with the underlying truth both in the characteristic eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the pseudo-deformation tensor, with the eigenvalues inferred from 30m-class telescopes correlated at {\$}r=0.95{\$} relative to the truth. As an output of this method, we are able to further evolve the inferred structures to late time ({\$}z=0{\$}), and also track the trajectories of coeval {\$}z=2.5{\$} galaxies to their {\$}z=0{\$} cosmic web environments.},

@article{Alpaslan2016,
abstract = {We look for correlated changes in stellar mass and star formation rate along filaments in the cosmic web by examining the stellar masses and UV-derived star formation rates (SFR) of 1,799 ungrouped and unpaired spiral galaxies that reside in filaments. We devise multiple distance metrics to characterise the complex geometry of filaments, and find that galaxies closer to the cylindrical centre of a filament have higher stellar masses than their counterparts near the periphery of filaments, on the edges of voids. In addition, these peripheral spiral galaxies have higher specific star formation rates (SSFR) at a given mass. Complementing our sample of filament spiral galaxies with spiral galaxies in tendrils and voids, we find that the average SFR of these objects in different large scale environments are similar to each other with the primary discriminant in SFR being stellar mass, in line with previous works. However, the distributions of SFRs are found to vary with large-scale environment. Our results thus suggest a model in which in addition to stellar mass as the primary discriminant, the large-scale environment is imprinted in the SFR as a second order effect. Furthermore, our detailed results for filament galaxies suggest a model in which gas accretion from voids onto filaments is primarily in an orthogonal direction. Overall, we find our results to be in line with theoretical expectations of the thermodynamic properties of the intergalactic medium in different large-scale environments.},

@article{Buncher2019,
abstract = {We present a novel method of robust probabilistic cosmic web particle classification in three dimensions using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Training data was generated using a simplified {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM toy model with pre-determined algorithms for generating halos, filaments, and voids. While this model lacks physical detail, it can be generated substantially more quickly than an N-body simulation without loss in classification accuracy. For each particle in this dataset, measurements were taken of the local density field and directionality. These measurements were used to train a random forest algorithm with, which was used to assign class probabilities to each particle in a {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM, dark matter-only N-body simulation with {\$}256{\^{}}3{\$} particles, as well as on another toy model data set. By comparing the trends in the ROC curves and other statistical metrics of predictions made on each of the datasets using different feature sets, we demonstrate that the combination of measurements of the local density field magnitude and directionality enables accurate and consistent classification of halo, filament, and void particles in varied environments. We also show that this combination of training features ensures that the construction of our toy model does not affect classification. The use of a fully supervised algorithm allows greater control over the information deemed important for classification, preventing issues arising from hyperparameters and mode collapse in deep learning models. Due to the speed of training data generation, our method is highly scalable, making it particularly suited for classifying large datasets, including observed data.},

We consider how to choose appropriate thresholds in the eigenvalues of the Hessian in order to partition the galaxies approximately evenly between environments. We find a significant variation in the luminosity function of galaxies between different geometric environments; the normalization, characterized by $\Phi$ * in a Schechter function fit, increases by an order of magnitude from voids to knots. The turnover magnitude, characterized by M*, brightens by approximately 0.5 mag from voids to knots. However, we show that the observed modulation can be entirely attributed to the indirect local-density dependence. We therefore find no evidence of a direct influence of the cosmic web on the galaxy luminosity function.},

@article{Shadab2019,
abstract = {Galaxies exhibit different clustering and quenching properties in clusters, filaments, and the field, but it is still uncertain whether such differences are imprints of the tidal environment on galaxy formation, or if they reflect the variation of the underlying halo mass function across the cosmic web. We measure the dependence of galaxy clustering and quenching on the cosmic web in the SDSS, characterized by the combination of overdensity $\delta$ 8 and tidal anisotropy $\alpha$ 5 centred on each galaxy. We find that galaxy clustering is a strong function of either $\delta$ 8 or $\alpha$ 5, and the large-scale galaxy bias shows complex and rich behaviour on the $\delta$ 8 versus $\alpha$ 5 plane. Using the mean galaxy colour as a proxy for the average quenched level of galaxies, we find that galaxy quenching is primarily a function of $\delta$ 8 , with some subtle yet non-trivial dependence on $\alpha$ 5 at fixed $\delta$ 8 . We compare these observed cosmic web dependences of galaxy clustering and quenching with a mock galaxy catalogue constructed from the iHOD model, which places quenched and star-forming galaxies inside dark matter haloes based on the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the halo quenching model - the $\delta$ 8 and $\alpha$ 5 dependences of iHOD galaxies are thus solely derived from the cosmic web modulation of the halo mass function. The main observed trends are accounted for extremely well by the iHOD model. Thus, any additional direct effect of the large-scale ({\textgreater}5h -1 ,Mpc) tidal field on galaxy formation must be extremely weak in comparison with the dominant indirect effects that arise from the environmental modulation of the halo mass function.},

@article{Cautun2014,
abstract = {The cosmic web is the largest scale manifestation of the anisotropic gravitational collapse of matter. It represents the transitional stage between linear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information about the early phases of structure formation processes. Here we investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components. Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis identifies clusters and filaments as the most prominent components of the web. In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present-day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids intowalls, and then via filaments into cluster regions,which form the nodes of the cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than 100 h-1 Mpc. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to form along approximatively straight lines. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

@article{Platen2007,
abstract = {ABSTRACT On megaparsec scales the Universe is permeated by an intricate filigree of clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, the cosmic web. For the understanding of its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is that of the dominant underdense voids, the product of a hierarchical process driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones. In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the watershed void finder (WVF), is based upon the watershed transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling noise. This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on a set of kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low-noise and high-noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the voids are successfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void size distribution function. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

@article{Platen2011,
abstract = {This study is the first in a series in which we analyse the structure and topology of the Cosmic Web as traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The main issue addressed in the present study is the translation of the irregularly distributed discrete spatial data in the galaxy redshift survey into a representative density field. The density field will form the basis for a statistical, topological and cosmographic study of the cosmic density field in our Local Universe. We investigate the ability of three reconstruction techniques to analyse and investigate web-like features and geometries in a discrete distribution of objects. The three methods are the linear Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE), its higher order equivalent Natural Neighbour Field Estimator (NNFE) and a version of the Kriging interpolation adapted to the specific circumstances encountered in galaxy redshift surveys, the Natural Lognormal Kriging technique. DTFE and NNFE are based on the local geometry defined by the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations of the galaxy distribution. The three reconstruction methods are analysed and compared using mock magnitude- and volume-limited SDSS redshift surveys, obtained on the basis of the Millennium simulation. We investigate error trends, biases and the topological structure of the resulting fields, concentrating on the void population identified by the Watershed Void Finder. Environmental effects are addressed by evaluating the density fields on a range of Gaussian filter scales. Comparison with the void population in the original simulation yields the fraction of false void mergers and false void splits. In most tests DTFE, NNFE and Kriging have largely similar density and topology error behaviour. Cosmetically, higher order NNFE and Kriging methods produce more visually appealing reconstructions. Quantitatively, however, DTFE performs better, even while being computationally far less demanding. A successful recovery of the void population on small scales appears to be difficult, while the void recovery rate improves significantly on scales {\textgreater}3h-1Mpc. A study of small-scale voids and the void galaxy population should therefore be restricted to the local Universe, out to at most 100h-1Mpc. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We develop a new method to reconstruct the cosmic density field from the distribution of dark matter haloes above a certain mass threshold. Our motivation is that well-defined samples of galaxy groups/clusters, which can be used to represent the dark halo population, can now be selected from large redshift surveys of galaxies, and our ultimate goal is to use such data to reconstruct the cosmic density field in the local Universe. Our reconstruction method starts with a sample of dark matter haloes above a given mass threshold. Each volume element in space is assigned to the domain of the nearest halo according to a distance measure that is scaled by the virial radius of the halo. The distribution of the mass in and around dark matter haloes of a given mass is modelled using the cross-correlation function between dark matter haloes and the mass distribution within their domains. We use N-body cosmological simulations to show that the density profiles required in our reconstruction scheme can be determined reliably from large cosmological simulations, and that our method can reconstruct the density field accurately using haloes with masses down to ∼10 12 h -1 M ⊙ (above which samples of galaxy groups can be constructed from current large redshift surveys of galaxies). Working in redshift space, we demonstrate that the redshift distortions due to the peculiar velocities of haloes can be corrected in an iterative way.

abstract = {We present a fully probabilistic, physical model of the non-linearly evolved density field, as probed by realistic galaxy surveys. Our model is valid in the linear and mildly nonlinear regimes and uses second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory to connect the initial conditions with the final density field. Our parameter space consists of the 3D initial density field and our method allows a fully Bayesian exploration of the sets of initial conditions that are consistent with the galaxy distribution sampling the final density field. A natural by-product of this technique is an optimal non-linear reconstruction of the present density and velocity fields, including a full propagation of the observational uncertainties. A test of these methods on simulated data mimicking the survey mask, selection function and galaxy number of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 main sample shows that this physical model gives accurate reconstructions of the underlying present-day density and velocity fields on scales larger than {\~{}}6 Mpc h-1. Our method naturally and accurately reconstructs non-linear features corresponding to three-point and higher order correlation functions such as walls and filaments.

abstract = {We discuss the skeleton as a probe of the filamentary structures of a two-dimensional random field. It can be defined for a smooth field as the ensemble of pairs of field lines departing from saddle points, initially aligned with the major axis of local curvature and connecting them to local maxima. This definition is thus non-local and makes analytical predictions difficult, so we propose a local approximation: the local skeleton is given by the set of points where the gradient is aligned with the local curvature major axis and where the second component of the local curvature is negative. We perform a statistical analysis of the length of the total local skeleton, chosen for simplicity as the set of all points of space where the gradient is either parallel or orthogonal to the main curvature axis. In all our numerical experiments, which include Gaussian and various non-Gaussian realizations such as $\chi$ 2 fields and Zel'dovich maps, the differential length f of the skeleton is found within a normalization factor to be very close to the probability distribution function (pdf) of the smoothed field, as expected and explicitly demonstrated in the Gaussian case where semi-analytical results are derived. As a result of the special nature of the skeleton, the differences between / and the pdf are small but noticeable. We find in the Gaussian case that they increase with the coherence parameter 0 ≤ $\gamma$ ≤ 1 of the field: f (x, $\gamma$) ≡ 1/ tot ∂/∂ chi; ≃1/√2$\pi$ e $\chi$2/2/2[1 + 0. 15$\gamma$ 2($\chi$ 2 - 1) - 0. 015$\gamma$ 4($\chi$ 2 - 6$\chi$ 2 + 3)]. Here, tot is the total length of the skeleton and ℒ(chi;) is the length of the skeleton in the excursion $\rho$ {\textgreater} $\sigma$ $\chi$ where $\sigma$ is the variance of the density field. This result makes the skeleton an interesting alternative probe of non-Gaussianity. Our analyses furthermore assume that the total length of the skeleton is a free, adjustable parameter. This total length could in fact be used to constrain cosmological models, in cosmic microwave background maps but also in three-dimensional galaxy catalogues, where it estimates the total length of filaments in the Universe. Making the link with other works, we also show how the skeleton can be used to study the dynamics of large-scale structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

The separatrices are classified into walls and the spine, the network of filaments and nodes in the matter distribution. Testing the method with a heuristic Voronoi model yields outstanding results.

@article{Aragon-Calvo2007,
abstract = {Aims. We present here a new method, MMF, for automatically segmenting cosmic structure into its basic components: clusters, filaments, and walls. Importantly, the segmentation is scale independent, so all structures are identified without prejudice as to their size or shape. The method is ideally suited for extracting catalogues of clusters, walls, and filaments from samples of galaxies in redshift surveys or from particles in cosmological N-body simulations: it makes no prior assumptions about the scale or shape of the structures. Methods. Our Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) method has been developed on the basis of visualization and feature extraction techniques in computer vision and medical research. The density or intensity field of the sample is smoothed over a range of scales. The smoothed signals are processed through a morphology response filter whose form is dictated by the particular morphological feature it seeks to extract, and depends on the local shape and spatial coherence of the intensity field. The morphology signal at each location is then defined to be the one with the maximum response across the full range of smoothing scales. The success of our method in identifying anisotropic features such as filaments and walls depends critically on the use of an optimally defined intensity field. This is accomplished by applying the DTFE reconstruction methodology to the sample particle or galaxy distribution. Results. We have tested our MMF Filter against a set of heuristic models of weblike patterns such as are seen in the Megaparsec cosmic matter distribution. To test its effectiveness in the context of more realistic configurations we also present preliminary results from the MMF analysis of an N-body model. Comparison with alternative prescriptions for feature extraction shows that MMF is a remarkably strong structure finder {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

@article{Zhang2009,
abstract = {Clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids are the building blocks of the cosmic web. Forming dark matter halos respond to these different large-scale environments, and this in turn affects the properties of galaxies hosted by the halos. It is therefore important to understand the systematic correlations of halo properties with the morphology of the cosmic web, as this informs both about galaxy formation physics and possible systematics of weak lensing studies. In this study, we present and compare two distinct algorithms for finding cosmic filaments and sheets, a task which is far less well established than the identification of dark matter halos or voids. One method is based on the smoothed dark matter density field and the other uses the halo distributions directly. We apply both techniques to one high-resolution N-body simulation and reconstruct the filamentary/sheet like network of the dark matter density field. We focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos inside these structures, in particular, on the directions of their spins and the orientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments and sheets. We find that both the spin and the major axes of filament halos with masses ≲1013 h -1 M ⊙ are preferentially aligned with the direction of the filaments. The spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel to the sheets. There is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strength for the spin (negative) and major (positive) axes, i.e. with increasing halo mass the major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of the filament, whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weaker with increasing halo mass. The alignment strength as a function of the distance to the most massive node halo indicates that there is a transit large-scale environment impact: from the two-dimensional collapse phase of the filament to the three-dimensional collapse phase of the cluster/node halo at small separation. Overall, the two algorithms for filament/sheet identification investigated here agree well with each other. The method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use with observational data sets. {\textcopyright} 2009. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The cosmic web plays a major role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and defines, to a large extent, their properties. However, the relation between galaxies and environment is still not well understood. Here, we present a machine learning approach to study imprints of environmental effects on the mass assembly of haloes. We present a galaxy-LSS machine learning classifier based on galaxy properties sensitive to the environment. We then use the classifier to assess the relevance of each property. Correlations between galaxy properties and their cosmic environment can be used to predict galaxy membership to void/wall or filament/cluster with an accuracy of 93 per cent. Our study unveils environmental information encoded in properties of haloes not normally considered directly dependent on the cosmic environment such as merger history and complexity. Understanding the physical mechanism by which the cosmic web is imprinted in a halo can lead to significant improvements in galaxy formation models. This is accomplished by extracting features from galaxy properties and merger trees, computing feature scores for each feature and then applying support vector machine (SVM) to different feature sets. To this end, we have discovered that the shape and depth of the merger tree, formation time, and density of the galaxy are strongly associated with the cosmic environment. We describe a significant improvement in the original classification algorithm by performing LU decomposition of the distance matrix computed by the feature vectors and then using the output of the decomposition as input vectors for SVM.},

This is a multiscale and automatic morphological analysis tool that identifies all the cosmic structures in a scale free way, without preference for a certain size or shape. We develop the NEXUS method to incorporate the density, tidal field, velocity divergence and velocity shear as tracers of the cosmic web. We also present the NEXUS+ procedure which, taking advantage of a novel filtering of the density in logarithmic space, is very successful at identifying the filament and wall environments in a robust and natural way. To assess the algorithms we apply them to an N-body simulation. We find that all methods correctly identify the most prominent filaments and walls, while there are differences in the detection of the more tenuous structures. In general, the structures traced by the density and tidal fields are clumpier and more rugged than those present in the velocity divergence and velocity shear fields. We find that the NEXUS+ method captures much better the filamentary and wall networks and is successful in detecting even the fainter structures. We also confirm the efficiency of our methods by examining the dark matter particle and halo distributions. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The detection and characterization of filamentary structures in the cosmic web allows cosmologists to constrain parameters that dictate the evolution of the Universe. While many filament estimators have been proposed, they generally lack estimates of uncertainty, reducing their inferential power. In this paper, we demonstrate how one may apply the subspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) algorithm (Ozertem {\&} Erdogmus 2011; Genovese et al. 2014) to uncover filamentary structure in galaxy data. The SCMS algorithm is a gradient ascent method that models filaments as density ridges, one-dimensional smooth curves that trace high-density regions within the point cloud. We also demonstrate how augmenting the SCMS algorithm with bootstrap-based methods of uncertainty estimation allows one to place uncertainty bands around putative filaments.We apply the SCMS first to the data set generated from the Voronoi model. The density ridges show strong agreement with the filaments from Voronoi method.We then apply the SCMS method data sets sampled from a P3M N-body simulation, with galaxy number densities consistent with SDSS and WFIRST-AFTA, and to LOWZ and CMASS data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). To further assess the efficacy of SCMS, we compare the relative locations of BOSS filaments with galaxy clusters in the redMaPPer catalogue, and find that redMaPPer clusters are significantly closer (with p-values {\textless} 10-9) to SCMS-detected filaments than to randomly selected galaxies.},

These components are: dark matter particles, gas cells, passive gas tracers, stars and stellar wind particles, and supermassive black holes. This data release includes the snapshots at all 136 available redshifts, halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot, and two distinct merger trees. Six primary realizations of the Illustris volume are released, including the flagship Illustris-1 run.

abstract = {We describe the Bayesian BARCODE formalism that has been designed towards the reconstruction of the Cosmic Web in a given volume on the basis of the sampled galaxy cluster distribution. Based on the realization that the massive compact clusters are responsible for the major share of the large scale tidal force field shaping the anisotropic and in particular filamentary features in the Cosmic Web. Given the non linearity of the constraints imposed by the cluster configurations, we resort to a state-of-the-art constrained reconstruction technique to find a proper statistically sampled realization of the original initial density and velocity field in the same cosmic region. Ultimately, the subsequent gravitational evolution of these initial conditions towards the implied Cosmic Web configuration can be followed on the basis of a proper analytical model or an N-body computer simulation. The BARCODE formalism includes an implicit treatment for redshift space distortions. This enables a direct reconstruction on the basis of observational data, without the need for a correction of redshift space artifacts. In this contribution we provide a general overview of the the Cosmic Web connection with clusters and a description of the Bayesian BARCODE formalism. We conclude with a presentation of its successful workings with respect to test runs based on a simulated large scale matter distribution, in physical space as well as in redshift space.},

abstract = {We present the largest Wiener reconstruction of the cosmic density field made to date. The reconstruction is based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 6 covering the northern Galactic cap. We use a novel supersampling algorithm to suppress aliasing effects and a Krylov-space inversion method to enable high performance with high resolution. These techniques are implemented in the argo computer code. We reconstruct the field over a 500 Mpc cube with Mpc grid resolution while accounting for both the angular and the radial selection functions of the SDSS, and the shot noise giving an effective resolution of the order of ∼10 Mpc. In addition, we correct for the redshift distortions in the linear and non-linear regimes in an approximate way. We show that the commonly used method of inverse weighting the galaxies by the corresponding selection function heads to excess noise in regions where the density of the observed galaxies is small. It is more accurate and conservative to adopt a Bayesian framework in which we model the galaxy selection/detection process to be Poisson binomial. This results in heavier smoothing in regions of reduced sampling density. Our results show a complex cosmic web structure with huge void regions indicating that the recovered matter distribution is highly non-Gaussian. Filamentary structures are clearly visible on scales of up to ∼20 Mpc. We also calculate the statistical distribution of density after smoothing the reconstruction with Gaussian kernels of different radii r S and find good agreement with a lognormal distribution for 10 Mpc ≲ rS ≲ 30 Mpc. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dynamical classification of the cosmic web. Each point in space is classified in one of four possible web types: voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor (i.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential) on a grid. The classification is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold, $\lambda$th, at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The collection of neighbouring grid points, friends of friends, of the same web type constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as extended web objects. A simple dynamical consideration of the emergence of the web suggests that the threshold should not be null, as in previous implementations of the algorithm. A detailed dynamical analysis would have found different threshold values for the collapse of sheets, filaments and knots. Short of such an analysis a phenomenological approach has been opted for, looking for a single threshold to be determined by analysing numerical simulations. Our cosmic web classification has been applied and tested against a suite of large (dark matter only) cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions on $\lambda$th and on the resolution has been calculated for the four web types. We also study the percolation properties of voids and filaments. Our main findings are as follows. (i) Already at $\lambda$th = 0.1 the resulting web classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (ii) Between 0.2 ≲ $\lambda$th ≲ 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of interconnected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for $\lambda$th as the parameter that defines the cosmic web. (iii) The dynamical nature of the suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating environmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular to semi-analytical models. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {Aims. We propose a decision criterion for segmenting the cosmic web into different structure types (voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters) on the basis of their respective probabilities and the strength of data constraints. Methods. Our approach is inspired by an analysis of games of chance where the gambler only plays if a positive expected net gain can be achieved based on some degree of privileged information. Results. The result is a general solution for classification problems in the face of uncertainty, including the option of not committing to a class for a candidate object. As an illustration, we produce high-resolution maps of web-type constituents in the nearby Universe as probed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey main galaxy sample. Other possible applications include the selection and labelling of objects in catalogues derived from astronomical survey data.},

abstract = {Using a sample of galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) and a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions, we study how the size distribution of galaxies depends on the intrinsic properties of galaxies, such as concentration, morphology, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and bulge fraction, and on the large-scale environments in the context of central/satellite decomposition, halo environment, the cosmic web: cluster, filament, sheet and void, as well as galaxy number density. We find that there is a strong dependence of the luminosity- or mass-size relation on the galaxy concentration, morphology, sSFR and bulge fraction. Compared with late-type (spiral) galaxies, there is a clear trend of smaller sizes and steeper slope for early-type (elliptical) galaxies. Similarly, galaxies with a high bulge fraction have smaller sizes and steeper slopes than those with a low bulge fraction. Fitting formulae of the average luminosity- and mass-size relations are provided for galaxies with these different intrinsic properties. Examining galaxies in terms of their large scale environments, we find that the mass-size relation has some weak dependence on the halo mass and central/satellite segregation for galaxies within mass range 9.0 ≤ log M ∗ ≤ 10.5, where satellites or galaxies in more massive halos have slightly smaller sizes than their counterparts, while the cosmic web and local number density dependence of the mass-size relation is almost negligible.},

@article{Burchett2020,
abstract = {Modern cosmology predicts that matter in our Universe has assembled today into a vast network of filamentary structures colloquially termed the Cosmic Web. Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark) or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are limited. Wide-field surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10{\%} of baryonic matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) via spectroscopy of distant quasars support the model yet have not conclusively tied the diffuse IGM to the web. Here, we report on a new method inspired by the Physarum polycephalum slime mold that is able to infer the density field of the Cosmic Web from galaxy surveys. Applying our technique to galaxy and absorption-line surveys of the local Universe, we demonstrate that the bulk of the IGM indeed resides in the Cosmic Web. From the outskirts of Cosmic Web filaments, at approximately the cosmic mean matter density (rho{\_}m) and approx. 5 virial radii from nearby galaxies, we detect an increasing H I absorption signature towards higher densities and the circumgalactic medium, to approx. 200 rho{\_}m. However, the absorption is suppressed within the densest environments, suggesting shock-heating and ionization deep within filaments and/or feedback processes within galaxies.},

A high-resolution N-body constrained simulation (CS) of the reconstructed initial condition, with {\$}3072{\^{}}3{\$} particles evolved in a 500 Mpc/h box, is carried out and analyzed in terms of the statistical properties of the final density field and its relation with the distribution of SDSS galaxies. We find that the statistical properties of the cosmic web and the halo populations are accurately reproduced in the CS. The galaxy density field is strongly correlated with the CS density field, with a bias that depend on both galaxy luminosity and color. Our further investigations show that the CS provides robust quantities describing the environments within which the observed galaxies and galaxy systems reside. Cosmic variance is greatly reduced in the CS so that the statistical uncertainties can be controlled effectively even for samples of small volumes.},

They adopt the biasing model which was previously found to provide a good match to observations of galaxy clustering on small and intermediate scales. The present investigation focuses on the properties of rich clusters, voids, filaments and other large-scale features. The model produces the observed abundance of Abell clusters of richness class greater than 0 and is consistent with estimates of the abundance of richer systems. In the model voids approaching the size of the one in Bootes are readily formed. The authors conclude that the results not only provide strong support for the cold dark matter model, but they also demonstrate that present observations of the galaxy distribution do not require an open universe, initial conditions with nonrandom phases, pregalactic explosions, or other large-scale nongravitational processes.},

This structure of galaxies consists of rich and poor clusters, connected by filaments and sheets, with regions largely devoid of galaxies (voids) in between1. Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2, 3, 18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the ‘web' of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that ‘superclusters' are filamentary cluster–cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together. {\textcopyright} 1996, Nature Publishing Group.

Here we analyze the use of DisPerSE to identify structure in observational data. We apply DisPerSE to the distribution of galaxies in the COSMOS field and find the best parameters to identify filaments. We compile a catalog of 11500 spectroscopic redshifts from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) G10 data release. We analyze two-dimensional slices, extract filaments and calculate the distance for each galaxy to its nearest filament. We find that redder and more massive galaxies are closer to filaments. To study the growth of galaxies across cosmic time, and environment, we are carrying out an HI survey covering redshifts z = 0 - 0.45, the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES). In addition we present the predicted HI mass fraction as a function of distance to filaments for the spectroscopically known galaxies in CHILES. Lastly, we discuss the cold gas morphology of a few individual galaxies and their positions with respect to the cosmic web. The identification of the cosmic web, and the ability of CHILES to study the resolved neutral hydrogen morphologies and kinematics of galaxies, will allow future studies of the properties of neutral hydrogen in different cosmic web environments across the redshift range z = 0.1 - 0.45.},

@article{Hahn2007,
abstract = {Using a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of the concordance cosmology we investigate how the formation histories, shapes and angular momenta of dark matter haloes depend on environment. We first present a classification scheme that allows us to distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple measure of the local density) is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to our simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M {\textless} M* (haloes of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are independent of it for larger masses (M* here indicates the typical mass scale which is entering the non-linear regime of perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in clusters are generally less spherical and more prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide accurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the spatial autocorrelation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin-orbit correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in filaments. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

@article{Sousbie2010,
abstract = {We present DisPerSE, a novel approach to the coherent multiscale identification of all types of astrophysical structures, in particular the filaments, in the large-scale distribution of the matter in the Universe. This method and the corresponding piece of software allows for a genuinely scale-free and parameter-free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the Delaunay tessellation field estimator density computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing of the density field is required. The idea is based on recent advances in distinct subdomains of the computational topology, namely the discrete Morse theory which allows for a rigorous application of topological principles to astrophysical data sets, and the theory of persistence, which allows us to consistently account for the intrinsic uncertainty and Poisson noise within data sets. Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of robustness with respect to noise (defined as a 'number of $\sigma$') and the algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters, filaments, walls and voids - filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling along the edges of walls bounding the voids. From a geometrical point of view, the method is also interesting as it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics, without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale. In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D simulated and observed data sets in the companion paper (Sousbie, Pichon {\&} Kawahara, Paper II). {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

@article{Zheng2005,
abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function {\textless}N{\textgreater} for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1 {\~{}} 14 Mmin (SPH) or M1 {\~{}} 18 Mmin (SA). The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M {\~{}} 10 Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. We show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a "bump" at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

@article{Libeskind2018,
abstract = {The cosmic web is one of the most striking features of the distribution of galaxies and dark matter on the largest scales in the Universe. It is composed of dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened sheets and vast low-density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused primarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the environmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety of different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web - depending on the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other. In this paper, we bring 12 of these methods together and apply them to the same data set in order to understand how they compare. In general, these cosmic-web classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind, and to study different questions. Therefore, one would not a priori expect agreement between different techniques; however, many of these methods do converge on the identification of specific features. In this paper, we study the agreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method finds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that voids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find a substantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification scheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example, we find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e. Mhalo {\~{}} 1013.5 h-1M⊙) as being in filaments. Lastly, so that any future cosmic-web classification scheme can be compared to the 12 methods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.},

abstract = {We present the first application of deep neural networks to the semantic segmentation of cosmological filaments and walls in the large-scale structure of the universe. Our results are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture trained using an existing state-of-the-art manually guided segmentation method. We successfully trained and tested a U-Net with a Voronoi model and an N-body simulation. The predicted segmentation masks from the Voronoi model have a Dice coefficient of 0.95 and 0.97 for filaments and masks, respectively. The predicted segmentation masks from the N-body simulation have a Dice coefficient of 0.78 and 0.72 for walls and filaments, respectively. The relatively lower Dice coefficient in the filament mask is the result of filaments that were predicted by the U-Net model but were not present in the original segmentation mask. Our results show that for a well-defined data set such as the Voronoi model the U-Net has excellent performance. In the case of the N-body data set, the U-Net produced a filament mask of higher quality than the segmentation mask obtained from a state-of-the art method. The U-Net performs better than the method used to train it, being able to find even the tenuous filaments that the manually guided segmentation failed to identify. The U-Net presented here can process a 5123 volume in a few minutes and without the need of complex pre-processing. Deep CNN have great potential as efficient and accurate analysis tools for the next generation large-volume computer N-body simulations and galaxy surveys.},
