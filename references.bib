abstract = {We present cosmological simulations which closely mimic the real Universe within 100Mpc of the Local Group. The simulations, called Constrained Simulations, reproduce the large-scale density field with major nearby structures, including the Local Group, the Coma and Virgo clusters, the Great Attractor, the Perseus-Pices, and the Local Supercluster, in approximately correct locations. The MARK III survey of peculiar velocities of the observed structures inside 80Mpc/h sphere is used to constrain the initial conditions. Fourier modes on scales larger then 5Mpc/h are dominated by the constraints, while small scale waves are random. The main aim of this paper is the structure of the Local Supercluster (LSC; 30Mpc/h around the Virgo cluster) and the Local Group environment. We find that at the current epoch most of the mass (7.5e14Msun/h) of the LSC is located in a filament roughly centered on the Virgo cluster and extending over 40Mpc/h. The simulated Local Group (LG) is located in an adjacent smaller filament, which is not a part of the main body of the LSC, and has a peculiar velocity of 250kms toward the Virgo cluster. The peculiar velocity field in the LSC region is complicated and is drastically different from the field assumed in the Virgocentric infall models. The peculiar velocity flow in the vicinity of the LG in the simulation is ``cold'': the peculiar line-of-sight velocity dispersion within 7Mpc/h of the LG is less than 60km/s, comparable to the observed velocity dispersion of nearby galaxies.},

@article{Novikov2003,
abstract = {We discuss the skeleton as a probe of the filamentary structures of a two-dimensional random field. It can be defined for a smooth field as the ensemble of pairs of field lines departing from saddle points, initially aligned with the major axis of local curvature and connecting them to local maxima. This definition is thus non-local and makes analytical predictions difficult, so we propose a local approximation: the local skeleton is given by the set of points where the gradient is aligned with the local curvature major axis and where the second component of the local curvature is negative. We perform a statistical analysis of the length of the total local skeleton, chosen for simplicity as the set of all points of space where the gradient is either parallel or orthogonal to the main curvature axis. In all our numerical experiments, which include Gaussian and various non-Gaussian realizations such as $\chi$ 2 fields and Zel'dovich maps, the differential length f of the skeleton is found within a normalization factor to be very close to the probability distribution function (pdf) of the smoothed field, as expected and explicitly demonstrated in the Gaussian case where semi-analytical results are derived. As a result of the special nature of the skeleton, the differences between / and the pdf are small but noticeable. We find in the Gaussian case that they increase with the coherence parameter 0 ≤ $\gamma$ ≤ 1 of the field: f (x, $\gamma$) ≡ 1/ tot ∂/∂ chi; ≃1/√2$\pi$ e $\chi$2/2/2[1 + 0. 15$\gamma$ 2($\chi$ 2 - 1) - 0. 015$\gamma$ 4($\chi$ 2 - 6$\chi$ 2 + 3)]. Here, tot is the total length of the skeleton and ℒ(chi;) is the length of the skeleton in the excursion $\rho$ {\textgreater} $\sigma$ $\chi$ where $\sigma$ is the variance of the density field. This result makes the skeleton an interesting alternative probe of non-Gaussianity. Our analyses furthermore assume that the total length of the skeleton is a free, adjustable parameter. This total length could in fact be used to constrain cosmological models, in cosmic microwave background maps but also in three-dimensional galaxy catalogues, where it estimates the total length of filaments in the Universe. Making the link with other works, we also show how the skeleton can be used to study the dynamics of large-scale structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

@article{Aragon-Calvo2007,
abstract = {Aims. We present here a new method, MMF, for automatically segmenting cosmic structure into its basic components: clusters, filaments, and walls. Importantly, the segmentation is scale independent, so all structures are identified without prejudice as to their size or shape. The method is ideally suited for extracting catalogues of clusters, walls, and filaments from samples of galaxies in redshift surveys or from particles in cosmological N-body simulations: it makes no prior assumptions about the scale or shape of the structures. Methods. Our Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF) method has been developed on the basis of visualization and feature extraction techniques in computer vision and medical research. The density or intensity field of the sample is smoothed over a range of scales. The smoothed signals are processed through a morphology response filter whose form is dictated by the particular morphological feature it seeks to extract, and depends on the local shape and spatial coherence of the intensity field. The morphology signal at each location is then defined to be the one with the maximum response across the full range of smoothing scales. The success of our method in identifying anisotropic features such as filaments and walls depends critically on the use of an optimally defined intensity field. This is accomplished by applying the DTFE reconstruction methodology to the sample particle or galaxy distribution. Results. We have tested our MMF Filter against a set of heuristic models of weblike patterns such as are seen in the Megaparsec cosmic matter distribution. To test its effectiveness in the context of more realistic configurations we also present preliminary results from the MMF analysis of an N-body model. Comparison with alternative prescriptions for feature extraction shows that MMF is a remarkably strong structure finder {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

@article{Zhang2009,
abstract = {Clusters, filaments, sheets, and voids are the building blocks of the cosmic web. Forming dark matter halos respond to these different large-scale environments, and this in turn affects the properties of galaxies hosted by the halos. It is therefore important to understand the systematic correlations of halo properties with the morphology of the cosmic web, as this informs both about galaxy formation physics and possible systematics of weak lensing studies. In this study, we present and compare two distinct algorithms for finding cosmic filaments and sheets, a task which is far less well established than the identification of dark matter halos or voids. One method is based on the smoothed dark matter density field and the other uses the halo distributions directly. We apply both techniques to one high-resolution N-body simulation and reconstruct the filamentary/sheet like network of the dark matter density field. We focus on investigating the properties of the dark matter halos inside these structures, in particular, on the directions of their spins and the orientation of their shapes with respect to the directions of the filaments and sheets. We find that both the spin and the major axes of filament halos with masses ≲1013 h -1 M ⊙ are preferentially aligned with the direction of the filaments. The spins and major axes of halos in sheets tend to lie parallel to the sheets. There is an opposite mass dependence of the alignment strength for the spin (negative) and major (positive) axes, i.e. with increasing halo mass the major axis tends to be more strongly aligned with the direction of the filament, whereas the alignment between halo spin and filament becomes weaker with increasing halo mass. The alignment strength as a function of the distance to the most massive node halo indicates that there is a transit large-scale environment impact: from the two-dimensional collapse phase of the filament to the three-dimensional collapse phase of the cluster/node halo at small separation. Overall, the two algorithms for filament/sheet identification investigated here agree well with each other. The method based on halos alone can be easily adapted for use with observational data sets. {\textcopyright} 2009. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The cosmic web plays a major role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and defines, to a large extent, their properties. However, the relation between galaxies and environment is still not well understood. Here, we present a machine learning approach to study imprints of environmental effects on the mass assembly of haloes. We present a galaxy-LSS machine learning classifier based on galaxy properties sensitive to the environment. We then use the classifier to assess the relevance of each property. Correlations between galaxy properties and their cosmic environment can be used to predict galaxy membership to void/wall or filament/cluster with an accuracy of 93 per cent. Our study unveils environmental information encoded in properties of haloes not normally considered directly dependent on the cosmic environment such as merger history and complexity. Understanding the physical mechanism by which the cosmic web is imprinted in a halo can lead to significant improvements in galaxy formation models. This is accomplished by extracting features from galaxy properties and merger trees, computing feature scores for each feature and then applying support vector machine (SVM) to different feature sets. To this end, we have discovered that the shape and depth of the merger tree, formation time, and density of the galaxy are strongly associated with the cosmic environment. We describe a significant improvement in the original classification algorithm by performing LU decomposition of the distance matrix computed by the feature vectors and then using the output of the decomposition as input vectors for SVM.},

This is a multiscale and automatic morphological analysis tool that identifies all the cosmic structures in a scale free way, without preference for a certain size or shape. We develop the NEXUS method to incorporate the density, tidal field, velocity divergence and velocity shear as tracers of the cosmic web. We also present the NEXUS+ procedure which, taking advantage of a novel filtering of the density in logarithmic space, is very successful at identifying the filament and wall environments in a robust and natural way. To assess the algorithms we apply them to an N-body simulation. We find that all methods correctly identify the most prominent filaments and walls, while there are differences in the detection of the more tenuous structures. In general, the structures traced by the density and tidal fields are clumpier and more rugged than those present in the velocity divergence and velocity shear fields. We find that the NEXUS+ method captures much better the filamentary and wall networks and is successful in detecting even the fainter structures. We also confirm the efficiency of our methods by examining the dark matter particle and halo distributions. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The detection and characterization of filamentary structures in the cosmic web allows cosmologists to constrain parameters that dictate the evolution of the Universe. While many filament estimators have been proposed, they generally lack estimates of uncertainty, reducing their inferential power. In this paper, we demonstrate how one may apply the subspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) algorithm (Ozertem {\&} Erdogmus 2011; Genovese et al. 2014) to uncover filamentary structure in galaxy data. The SCMS algorithm is a gradient ascent method that models filaments as density ridges, one-dimensional smooth curves that trace high-density regions within the point cloud. We also demonstrate how augmenting the SCMS algorithm with bootstrap-based methods of uncertainty estimation allows one to place uncertainty bands around putative filaments.We apply the SCMS first to the data set generated from the Voronoi model. The density ridges show strong agreement with the filaments from Voronoi method.We then apply the SCMS method data sets sampled from a P3M N-body simulation, with galaxy number densities consistent with SDSS and WFIRST-AFTA, and to LOWZ and CMASS data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). To further assess the efficacy of SCMS, we compare the relative locations of BOSS filaments with galaxy clusters in the redMaPPer catalogue, and find that redMaPPer clusters are significantly closer (with p-values {\textless} 10-9) to SCMS-detected filaments than to randomly selected galaxies.},

Based on the realization that the massive compact clusters are responsible for the major share of the large scale tidal force field shaping the anisotropic and in particular filamentary features in the Cosmic Web. Given the nonlinearity of the constraints imposed by the cluster configurations, we resort to a state-of-the-art constrained reconstruction technique to find a proper statistically sampled realization of the original initial density and velocity field in the same cosmic region. Ultimately, the subsequent gravitational evolution of these initial conditions towards the implied Cosmic Web configuration can be followed on the basis of a proper analytical model or an N-body computer simulation. The BARCODE formalism includes an implicit treatment for redshift space distortions. This enables a direct reconstruction on the basis of observational data, without the need for a correction of redshift space artifacts. In this contribution we provide a general overview of the the Cosmic Web connection with clusters and a description of the Bayesian BARCODE formalism. We conclude with a presentation of its successful workings with respect to test runs based on a simulated large scale matter distribution, in physical space as well as in redshift space.},

abstract = {We present the largest Wiener reconstruction of the cosmic density field made to date. The reconstruction is based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 6 covering the northern Galactic cap. We use a novel supersampling algorithm to suppress aliasing effects and a Krylov-space inversion method to enable high performance with high resolution. These techniques are implemented in the argo computer code. We reconstruct the field over a 500 Mpc cube with Mpc grid resolution while accounting for both the angular and the radial selection functions of the SDSS, and the shot noise giving an effective resolution of the order of ∼10 Mpc. In addition, we correct for the redshift distortions in the linear and non-linear regimes in an approximate way. We show that the commonly used method of inverse weighting the galaxies by the corresponding selection function heads to excess noise in regions where the density of the observed galaxies is small. It is more accurate and conservative to adopt a Bayesian framework in which we model the galaxy selection/detection process to be Poisson binomial. This results in heavier smoothing in regions of reduced sampling density. Our results show a complex cosmic web structure with huge void regions indicating that the recovered matter distribution is highly non-Gaussian. Filamentary structures are clearly visible on scales of up to ∼20 Mpc. We also calculate the statistical distribution of density after smoothing the reconstruction with Gaussian kernels of different radii r S and find good agreement with a lognormal distribution for 10 Mpc ≲ rS ≲ 30 Mpc. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dynamical classification of the cosmic web. Each point in space is classified in one of four possible web types: voids, sheets, filaments and knots. The classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor (i.e. the Hessian of the gravitational potential) on a grid. The classification is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold, $\lambda$th, at each grid point, where the case of zero, one, two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. The collection of neighbouring grid points, friends of friends, of the same web type constitutes voids, sheets, filaments and knots as extended web objects. A simple dynamical consideration of the emergence of the web suggests that the threshold should not be null, as in previous implementations of the algorithm. A detailed dynamical analysis would have found different threshold values for the collapse of sheets, filaments and knots. Short of such an analysis a phenomenological approach has been opted for, looking for a single threshold to be determined by analysing numerical simulations. Our cosmic web classification has been applied and tested against a suite of large (dark matter only) cosmological N-body simulations. In particular, the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions on $\lambda$th and on the resolution has been calculated for the four web types. We also study the percolation properties of voids and filaments. Our main findings are as follows. (i) Already at $\lambda$th = 0.1 the resulting web classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web. (ii) Between 0.2 ≲ $\lambda$th ≲ 0.4, a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of interconnected filaments. This suggests a reasonable choice for $\lambda$th as the parameter that defines the cosmic web. (iii) The dynamical nature of the suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating environmental information into galaxy formation models, and in particular to semi-analytical models. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

As an illustration, we produce high-resolution maps of web-type constituents in the nearby Universe as probed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey main galaxy sample.

abstract = {Using a sample of galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) and a catalog of bulge-disk decompositions, we study how the size distribution of galaxies depends on the intrinsic properties of galaxies, such as concentration, morphology, specific star formation rate (sSFR), and bulge fraction, and on the large-scale environments in the context of central/satellite decomposition, halo environment, the cosmic web: cluster, filament, sheet and void, as well as galaxy number density. We find that there is a strong dependence of the luminosity- or mass-size relation on the galaxy concentration, morphology, sSFR and bulge fraction. Compared with late-type (spiral) galaxies, there is a clear trend of smaller sizes and steeper slope for early-type (elliptical) galaxies. Similarly, galaxies with a high bulge fraction have smaller sizes and steeper slopes than those with a low bulge fraction. Fitting formulae of the average luminosity- and mass-size relations are provided for galaxies with these different intrinsic properties. Examining galaxies in terms of their large scale environments, we find that the mass-size relation has some weak dependence on the halo mass and central/satellite segregation for galaxies within mass range 9.0 ≤ log M ∗ ≤ 10.5, where satellites or galaxies in more massive halos have slightly smaller sizes than their counterparts, while the cosmic web and local number density dependence of the mass-size relation is almost negligible.},

@article{Burchett2020,
abstract = {Modern cosmology predicts that matter in our Universe has assembled today into a vast network of filamentary structures colloquially termed the Cosmic Web. Because this matter is either electromagnetically invisible (i.e., dark) or too diffuse to image in emission, tests of this cosmic web paradigm are limited. Wide-field surveys do reveal web-like structures in the galaxy distribution, but these luminous galaxies represent less than 10{\%} of baryonic matter. Statistics of absorption by the intergalactic medium (IGM) via spectroscopy of distant quasars support the model yet have not conclusively tied the diffuse IGM to the web. Here, we report on a new method inspired by the Physarum polycephalum slime mold that is able to infer the density field of the Cosmic Web from galaxy surveys. Applying our technique to galaxy and absorption-line surveys of the local Universe, we demonstrate that the bulk of the IGM indeed resides in the Cosmic Web. From the outskirts of Cosmic Web filaments, at approximately the cosmic mean matter density (rho{\_}m) and approx. 5 virial radii from nearby galaxies, we detect an increasing H I absorption signature towards higher densities and the circumgalactic medium, to approx. 200 rho{\_}m. However, the absorption is suppressed within the densest environments, suggesting shock-heating and ionization deep within filaments and/or feedback processes within galaxies.},

We find that the statistical properties of the cosmic web and the halo populations are accurately reproduced in the CS. The galaxy density field is strongly correlated with the CS density field, with a bias that depend on both galaxy luminosity and color. Our further investigations show that the CS provides robust quantities describing the environments within which the observed galaxies and galaxy systems reside.

The model produces the observed abundance of Abell clusters of richness class greater than 0 and is consistent with estimates of the abundance of richer systems. In the model voids approaching the size of the one in Bootes are readily formed.

This structure of galaxies consists of rich and poor clusters, connected by filaments and sheets, with regions largely devoid of galaxies (voids) in between1. Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2, 3, 18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the ‘web' of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that ‘superclusters' are filamentary cluster–cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together. {\textcopyright} 1996, Nature Publishing Group.

We compile a catalog of 11500 spectroscopic redshifts from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) G10 data release. We analyze two-dimensional slices, extract filaments and calculate the distance for each galaxy to its nearest filament. We find that redder and more massive galaxies are closer to filaments. To study the growth of galaxies across cosmic time, and environment, we are carrying out an HI survey covering redshifts z = 0 - 0.45, the COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey (CHILES). In addition we present the predicted HI mass fraction as a function of distance to filaments for the spectroscopically known galaxies in CHILES. Lastly, we discuss the cold gas morphology of a few individual galaxies and their positions with respect to the cosmic web. The identification of the cosmic web, and the ability of CHILES to study the resolved neutral hydrogen morphologies and kinematics of galaxies, will allow future studies of the properties of neutral hydrogen in different cosmic web environments across the redshift range z = 0.1 - 0.45.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the position of an interaction for any dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC) with the best precision is key to directly detecting Dark Matter. Using the likelihood-free framework, a new algorithm to reconstruct the 2-D (x,y) position and the size of the charge signal (e) of an interaction is presented. The algorithm uses the secondary scintillation light distribution (S2) obtained by simulating events using a waveform generator. To deal with the computational effort required by the likelihood-free approach, we employ the Bayesian Optimization for Likelihood-Free Inference (BOLFI) algorithm. Together with BOLFI, prior distributions for the parameters of interest (x,y,e) and highly informative discrepancy measures to perform the analyses are introduced. We evaluate the quality of the proposed algorithm by a comparison against the currently existing alternative methods using a large-scale simulation study. BOLFI provides a natural probabilistic uncertainty measure for the reconstruction and it improved the accuracy of the reconstruction over the next best algorithm by up to 15{\%} when focusing on events at large radii (R {\textgreater} 30 cm, the outer 37{\%} of the detector). In addition, BOLFI provides the smallest uncertainties among all the tested methods.},

@article{Hahn2007,
abstract = {Using a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of the concordance cosmology we investigate how the formation histories, shapes and angular momenta of dark matter haloes depend on environment. We first present a classification scheme that allows us to distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple measure of the local density) is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to our simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M {\textless} M* (haloes of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are independent of it for larger masses (M* here indicates the typical mass scale which is entering the non-linear regime of perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in clusters are generally less spherical and more prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide accurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the spatial autocorrelation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin-orbit correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in filaments. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

@article{Sousbie2010,
abstract = {We present DisPerSE, a novel approach to the coherent multiscale identification of all types of astrophysical structures, in particular the filaments, in the large-scale distribution of the matter in the Universe. This method and the corresponding piece of software allows for a genuinely scale-free and parameter-free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the Delaunay tessellation field estimator density computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing of the density field is required. The idea is based on recent advances in distinct subdomains of the computational topology, namely the discrete Morse theory which allows for a rigorous application of topological principles to astrophysical data sets, and the theory of persistence, which allows us to consistently account for the intrinsic uncertainty and Poisson noise within data sets. Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of robustness with respect to noise (defined as a 'number of $\sigma$') and the algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters, filaments, walls and voids - filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling along the edges of walls bounding the voids. From a geometrical point of view, the method is also interesting as it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics, without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale. In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D simulated and observed data sets in the companion paper (Sousbie, Pichon {\&} Kawahara, Paper II). {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

@article{Zheng2005,
abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function {\textless}N{\textgreater} for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites, and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1 {\~{}} 14 Mmin (SPH) or M1 {\~{}} 18 Mmin (SA). The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M {\~{}} 10 Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. We show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a "bump" at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

abstract = {The cosmic web is one of the most striking features of the distribution of galaxies and dark matter on the largest scales in the Universe. It is composed of dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened sheets and vast low-density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused primarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the environmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety of different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web - depending on the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other. In this paper, we bring 12 of these methods together and apply them to the same data set in order to understand how they compare. In general, these cosmic-web classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind, and to study different questions. Therefore, one would not a priori expect agreement between different techniques; however, many of these methods do converge on the identification of specific features. In this paper, we study the agreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method finds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that voids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find a substantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification scheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example, we find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e. Mhalo {\~{}} 1013.5 h-1M⊙) as being in filaments. Lastly, so that any future cosmic-web classification scheme can be compared to the 12 methods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.},

abstract = {We present the first application of deep neural networks to the semantic segmentation of cosmological filaments and walls in the large-scale structure of the universe. Our results are based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture trained using an existing state-of-the-art manually guided segmentation method. We successfully trained and tested a U-Net with a Voronoi model and an N-body simulation. The predicted segmentation masks from the Voronoi model have a Dice coefficient of 0.95 and 0.97 for filaments and masks, respectively. The predicted segmentation masks from the N-body simulation have a Dice coefficient of 0.78 and 0.72 for walls and filaments, respectively. The relatively lower Dice coefficient in the filament mask is the result of filaments that were predicted by the U-Net model but were not present in the original segmentation mask. Our results show that for a well-defined data set such as the Voronoi model the U-Net has excellent performance. In the case of the N-body data set, the U-Net produced a filament mask of higher quality than the segmentation mask obtained from a state-of-the art method. The U-Net performs better than the method used to train it, being able to find even the tenuous filaments that the manually guided segmentation failed to identify. The U-Net presented here can process a 5123 volume in a few minutes and without the need of complex pre-processing. Deep CNN have great potential as efficient and accurate analysis tools for the next generation large-volume computer N-body simulations and galaxy surveys.},
